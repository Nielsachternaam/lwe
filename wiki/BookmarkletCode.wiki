= What's a bookmarklet? =

A bookmarklet is an applet, a small computer application, stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet (wikipedia)]

= Bookmarklet code =

{{{
javascript:if(lwe){lwe.stop()}else{var%20lwe=document.createElement('script');lwe.setAttribute('src','http://tinyurl.com/lwe-trunk');document.body.appendChild(lwe)};void(lwe);
}}}

= Howto add this bookmarklet into your browser =

As Google Code doesn't allow javascript linking, you'll have to create it yourself:
 # Right-click on your bookmark toolbar and select _create new bookmark_
 # Give your bookmarklet a name, and paste the Javascript code into the location field
 # Save it, and it's done!
Now while you are browsing a website you'd like to edit, simply click on your bookmarklet and let the magic go on!
